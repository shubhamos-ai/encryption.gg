## 🔐 What Is This?

**SHUBHAMOS Secure Crypt** is a privacy-centric encryption service designed for **temporary and irreversible data exchange**.

It allows users to encrypt **images and text**, retrieve them securely, and guarantees that **everything self-destructs** after use or expiry.

No persistence.  
No recovery.  
No silent storage.

---

## 🧠 Philosophy

> **If data must exist, let it exist briefly.**

This project follows a **zero-trust mindset**:
- Every request is isolated
- Every key is unique
- Every file has a lifespan
- Every mistake results in destruction, not leakage

---

## ✨ Features

### 🔑 One-Time Encryption
- Unique key per request
- No reuse
- No regeneration

### ⏳ Auto-Destruction Engine
- Files expire automatically
- Downloads trigger immediate deletion
- Background cleanup runs continuously

### 🚦 Smart Queue System
- Prevents overload
- Fair request handling
- Live position tracking

### 🧾 Session-Scoped History
- Temporary session memory
- Expired entries disappear silently
- No permanent tracking

### 🔒 Failure-Safe Design
- Invalid keys → no output
- Corrupted data → rejected
- Partial downloads → destroyed

⚠️ **Lose the key = data is gone forever**

## ✉️ Text Encryption Flow

```

Text → Encrypt → Payload + Key → Decrypt → Auto Expire

```

- No storage
- No logs
- No recovery mechanism

---

## 🔐 Security Model

- Isolated encryption per request
- Short-lived encrypted artifacts
- No shared secrets
- No server-side recovery

> **Security failures destroy data instead of exposing it.**

---

## 🧪 Ideal Use Cases

- Secure image sharing
- Ephemeral communication
- Temporary data exchange
- Privacy-focused workflows
- Security education & demos
- Proof-of-concept encryption systems

---

## ⚠️ Important Warnings

🚨 **THIS SYSTEM IS INTENTIONALLY UNFORGIVING**

- Keys are NOT recoverable
- Expired data is permanently deleted
- There is no “forgot password”
- There is no admin recovery
- There are no backups

**This is not cloud storage.  
This is controlled data loss.**

---

## 🕶️ Dark-Mode Friendly

This project is designed to look and feel at home in:
- Dark terminals
- Cyberpunk dashboards
- Hacker-style UIs
- Minimal security panels

---

## 📜 Security Disclaimer
