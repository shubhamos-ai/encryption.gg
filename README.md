## 🔐 What Is This?

**SHUBHAMOS Secure Crypt** is a privacy-focused encryption service built for  
**temporary, one-time, irreversible data exchange**.

It allows users to encrypt **images and text**, retrieve them securely, and ensures
that **all data self-destructs** after use or expiry.

No persistence.  
No recovery.  
No silent storage.

---

## 🧠 Design Philosophy

> **If data must exist, it should exist briefly.**

This system follows a **zero-trust mindset**:

- Each request is isolated
- Each key is unique
- Each file has a defined lifespan
- Any failure results in destruction, not exposure

---

## ✨ Core Features

### 🔑 One-Time Encryption
- Unique key per request
- Keys cannot be reused
- No regeneration possible

### ⏳ Automatic Destruction
- Time-based expiry
- Instant deletion after download
- Continuous cleanup process

### 🚦 Request Queue Control
- Prevents abuse and overload
- Fair request handling
- Live position tracking

### 🧾 Session-Scoped History
- Temporary session visibility
- Expired entries vanish automatically
- No permanent tracking

### 🔒 Failure-Safe Handling
- Invalid keys return nothing
- Corrupted payloads are rejected
- Partial downloads are destroyed

⚠️ **Losing the key permanently destroys the data**

## ✉️ Text Encryption Flow

```

Text → Encrypt → Payload + Key → Decrypt → Auto Expire

```

- No storage
- No logging
- No recovery path

---

## 🔐 Security Model Overview

- Isolated encryption per request
- Short-lived encrypted artifacts
- No shared secrets
- No server-side recovery

> **Security failures destroy data instead of exposing it.**

---

## 🧪 Ideal Use Cases

- Secure image sharing
- Ephemeral communication
- Temporary secret exchange
- Privacy-focused workflows
- Security demonstrations
- Encryption proof-of-concepts

---

## ⚠️ Critical Warnings

🚨 **THIS SYSTEM IS INTENTIONALLY UNFORGIVING**

- Keys are **not recoverable**
- Expired data is **permanently deleted**
- No admin override
- No backups
- No undo

**This is not cloud storage.  
This is controlled data loss.**
